We are using Microsoft Teams as our F-2-F collaboration mode. 
The reason behind the decision is as follows:
- Microsoft Teams has excellent built-in features such as: screen sharing, recording, quick communication chat box, control sharing, to support team co-ordination activities.
- All the team members are accustomed with the tool and hence, it becomes easier to work on the assingment using this tool.
- The tool helps to make the team communication meaningful by keeping team members informed.
